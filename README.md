How It Works

HTML: Defines the basic structure of the page with a header, a post form, and a feed areas

CSS: Styles the page to look clean and simple.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for toggling the post form visibility and adding new posts to the feed.

Usage

View Profile: Not included in this example, but you could add a user profile section.
Add Posts: Click "Add Post" to show the form, enter content, and submit.

This setup is a starting point. You can expand it with features like user authentication, media uploads, and more sophisticated styles.
